Website about Combinatorics
This is a website I have worked on during my second year in highschool with 2 other colleagues of mine.
It represents a mean of education, more precisely in the fields of Mathematics, Combinatorics, with applications in Computer Science.
It has some "lectures", animations and exercises to explain them better.
